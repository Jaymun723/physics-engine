# Vysics Engine Playground

⚠️ This project is still in early development !

> Little project to showcase the engine. Graphics based on [Vancas](https://github.com/Voxylu/vancas).
> For now the code of the playground is a bit messy...
> Nonetheless it's a good overview of a how to use the vysics-engine.

## Usage

Start the development server with:

```sh
npm start
```

## TODO

- More powerful creation of objects (polygons !)
- Mouse constraint (maybe in replacement of force application)
